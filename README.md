# smartphone-price-analysis
Project Overview

• Exploratory data analysis (EDA) project analyzing smartphone pricing trends
• Examines how specifications such as RAM, storage, battery, and camera affect price
• Includes visualizations, feature relationships, and insights

Objectives

• Explore key smartphone specifications
• Identify patterns and correlations among features
• Analyze how each feature influences device pricing
• Provide insights into pricing strategy and market segments

Tools Used

• Python
• Pandas
• NumPy
• Matplotlib
• Seaborn
• Jupyter Notebook

Files in This Repository

• smartphone_price_analysis.ipynb — Main notebook
• sample_smartphones.csv — Sample dataset
• README.md — Documentation

Dataset Source

• Dataset loaded from local storage in the notebook
• A sample dataset is included for demonstration

Important Note (Path Adjustment Required)

• The notebook currently loads the dataset using a local file path
• Users must update the path according to their system
• Or use the provided sample_smartphones.csv file

Key Insights

• Price strongly correlates with RAM, storage, and camera quality
• Premium smartphones show distinct feature clusters
• Battery capacity and display specifications also influence cost
• Scatterplots and correlation heatmaps reveal clear trends

Market Interpretation

• Consumers pay more for high-performance features
• Brands compete heavily in mid-range pricing tiers
• Feature combinations predict price segments effectively

How to Run

• Download this repository
• Ensure the sample dataset is in the same folder as the notebook
• Open the notebook in Jupyter
• Update the dataset path if needed
• Run all cells sequentially
